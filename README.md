Hi, I'm Dev Patel, an 18-year-old First-Year Computer Science student at Toronto Metropolitan University. Focused on coding, problem-solving, and tech trends, I'm particularly interested in AI and machine learning. I aim to explore opportunities in BioTech or FinTech after graduation, applying my skills for real-world impact. Actively collaborating on AI projects with peers, I seek internships and mentorships in these industries to gain practical insights for future contributions.
