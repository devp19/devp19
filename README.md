Hey, I'm Dev Patel, an 18-year-old, First-Year Computer Science student at Toronto Metropolitan University. In my program, I'm focused on coding, problem-solving, and ideally keeping up with tech trends. As I tackle coursework and coding challenges, I'm particularly interested in artificial intelligence and machine learning. Looking ahead, I'm leaning towards exploring opportunities in BioTech or FinTech after graduation, where I hope to apply my skills to make a real-world impact. In my pursuit of merging technology with real-world applications, I have actively collaborated with fellow students on AI and machine learning projects, further solidifying my coding proficiency. Beyond the academic setting, I am exploring internships and mentorship opportunities in BioTech and FinTech, eager to gain practical insights that will inform my future contributions in these dynamic industries.
